# Christmas Tree Visualizer
A python wrapper for creating effects for Matt Parker's christmas tree.

To use it you need to do a few simple things:
- have *python3* and modules *tkinter* & *matplotlib* installed
- get *GIFT* format coordinates for the tree you want to create an effect for ([official 2021](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lmccfutftplhh3b/coords_2021.csv?dl=0))
- download the [visualizer.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aonodensetsu/xmax-tree-visualizer/main/visualiser.py)
- rename the GIFT to coordinates.csv
- download the template [tree_effect.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aonodensetsu/xmax-tree-visualizer/main/tree_effect.py) or create your own
- put coordinates.csv and tree_effect.py into the same folder as visualizer.py
- run visualizer.py, it will show you how the effect looks and generate tree_effect.csv which is compliant with [GSD6338/XmasTree](https://github.com/GSD6338/XmasTree).
