# Christmas Tree Visualizer
A python wrapper for creating effects for Matt Parker's xmax tree

To use it you need to do a few simple things:
- have python and modules *csv*, *tkinter*, *matplotlib* installed
- get GIFT format coordinates for the tree you want to create an effect for
- download the visualizer.py
- use the template tree_effect.py or create your own
- run visualizer.py, it will show you how the effect looks and generate tree_effect.csv which is compliant with GSD6338/XmasTree.
